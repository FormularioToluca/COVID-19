## Usage as library user

You need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) in at least version 5.3. Or at least [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in version 10.

And/or copy the [.npmrc](.npmrc) into your project root. It will tell your npm where to take the `@inst-iot` scoped packages from.

Install it from the repository:

    npm install @inst-iot/bosch-angular-ui-components
    npm install flatpickr


Include the following lines into your styles.scss:

    $font-path: "../node_modules/@inst-iot/bosch-angular-ui-components/assets/";
    $rb-extended-breakpoints: false;  // whether to use extended breakpoints xxl and xxxl
    @import "~@inst-iot/bosch-angular-ui-components/styles/global.scss";
    
*Note: In case you would like to add bootstrap, add it beforehand.*

Include the following into your `.angular.json` assets:

    { "glob": "**/*", "input": "./node_modules/@inst-iot/bosch-angular-ui-components/assets/", "output": "./assets/" },


Include it into your app module:
    
    import { RbUiComponentsModule } from '@inst-iot/bosch-angular-ui-components';
    ....
    imports: [
        RbUiComponentsModule
    ]


See `src/app/demo` how to use it.



## As library developer

## Notes

Most of the `src/styles` were copied from the [rb clickdummy](https://sourcecode.socialcoding.bosch.com/projects/CIBDX/repos/rb.clickdummy.ro-npm/browse)

## Known issues

If you use Angular 7 with `@angular-devkit/build-angular@0.10.x`, the autoprefixer will not work correctly with grid layout in Internet Explorer.
You need to use at least `@angular-devkit/build-angular@0.11.0-beta.1` in your project to get the latest autoprefixer version, which adds the -ms- prefixes again for Internet Explorer.
